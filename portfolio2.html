					<h3>Information Systems</h3>
					<p>
						An introduction to the use of information systems in organisations which will show you how to develop key systems analysis techniques to be applied to information systems built on a commercial Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). You will also develop essential communication and teamworking skills. Topics include:
						Business activities supported by information systems including case studies and examples
						Use of information systems for management information and decision making, business operations and data processing
						E-commerce theory, information systems and society
						Systems analysis and design techniques including UML use cases
						Database management systems and database design/development: entity relationship diagrams (ERDs), normalisation, SQL
					</p>
					<p>
						This unit is about the databases and information systems. We have learned about user case diagrams, 
						ERDs, RDAs and how to create a report on the issues of the system that they use and the requirements
						and what they need to build the new system.

					<h3>Computer Systems Fundamentals</h3>
					<p>
						This unit provides an introduction to the fundamental principles and mathematics underpinning the design and construction of computer systems, including:
						Digital Logic and Boolean Algebra: digital logic gates and circuits, Karnaugh maps, use of a digital logic circuit simulator, components of a CPU, processor model, Fetch execute cycle, hardware interrupts
						Assembly Language Programming: relationship between high level languages and assembler, instruction sets, registers, debugging
						Discrete Mathematics: matrices and vectors, matrices as linear transforms
						Functions: definition, properties
						Sets: subsets, set algebra
						Logic: propositions, predicates, propositional algebra, proof of simple results
						Introduces the modern context of web design and development, the core development 
						technologies and standards and design methods that cater for different current
						platforms. The key theme of the unit is the efficient design and development of 
						effective and robust websites for the range of popular platforms using the most 
						modern technologies and techniques. Topics include: Introduction to the 
						client-server model, web standards, HTML5 semantic mark up, control of presentation 
						via style sheets, interactivity via JavaScript on the client side and PHP on the 
						server side The use of high-level tools for design and development DOM element 
						selection and manipulation via script libraries such as jQuery The production of 
						standards compliant HTML5 video. Students will create dynamic web pages with AMP 
						systems and script on the server side using PHP with MySQL. The key theme for 
						scripting will be the understanding and development of readable code that 
						listens for and responds to browser and user events by manipulating DOM elements.
					</p>
					<p>
						This unit is divided into two subjects, Mathematics and Computer Systems. In Mathematics we
						are learning the basics of Discrete Math and in Computer Systems, we learned about the logic gates,
						how the ALU works and is built using these logic gates. Overall this unit is easy.
