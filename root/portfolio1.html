					<h3>Programming</h3>
					<p>
						This unit introduces computer programming in a high level programming language and includes 
						principles and practice in problem solving, program design, solution implementation and testing, including:
						Introduction to programming using Java
						Software life cycle: importance of correctly identifying the problem, iterative nature of 
						software development, software maintenance
						Design methodology: the application of the top-down design method using step-wise refinement 
						to produce pseudo-code solutions to problems, incorporating constructs for sequence selection,
						iteration, abstraction and re-use
						Verification and testing: the use of desk-top execution, simple debugging strategies and more 
						formal approaches to testing e.g. black box white box boundary analysis and equivalence classes
						Applications of standards and conventions: software maintenance and developing a professional 
						approach to coding
						Constructs and features of a structured high level programming language: control constructs, 
						operators, procedural abstraction, simple I/O and use of libraries
						Data types â€“ primitive types: constants, variables, arrays and simple structured data
						Object orientated design and implementation: inheritance and polymorphism
						Software support environment: use of an IDE editors compiler/linkers and operating systems

						In this unit, so far we have covered, the variables, methods, procedures, loops and conditions. I find
						this unit easy for now and i am enjoying to learn how the instructions are given to the computer and 
						how it runs the applications on the computer. My course is mainly focused on the software development 
						and as that is what i want to learn, i am finding this unit very interesting.
					</p>
					<p>
						On the right, there is an example of the use of processing to create a block of balls 
						and filling them with a colour. On the code we have written, when the x=y draw the circle and 
						fill it with the colour red while the rest will be green. After writing the code we press the play 
						button which runs the code typed and shows the result of the code in another window which can be seen
						on the top of the code in a smaller window.

					<h3>Introduction to Web Design and Development</h3>
					<p>
						Introduces the modern context of web design and development, the core development technologies and 
						standards and design methods that cater for different current platforms. The key theme of 
						the unit is the efficient design and development of effective and robust websites for the range of 
						popular platforms using the most modern technologies and techniques.
						Topics include:
						Introduction to the client-server model, web standards, HTML5 semantic mark up, control of 
						presentation via style sheets, 
						interactivity via JavaScript on the client side and PHP on the server side
						The use of high-level tools for design and development
						DOM element selection and manipulation via script libraries such as jQuery
						The production of standards compliant HTML5 video. Students will create dynamic web pages with 
						AMP systems and script on 
						the server side using PHP with MySQL. The key theme for scripting will be the understanding and 
						development of readable code that listens 
						for and responds to browser and user events by manipulating DOM elements.
					</p>
					<p>
						This unit is all about developing the websites. This website is an example of the work we are doing.
						We have been taught about HTML 5, CSS 3 and usability and accessibility of the website. This unit is easy
						to learn but is really hard to implement as you have to make decisions in every step whether you have
						to use the code or not. And if you use the wrong code from the basics and it does not work later because
						of that code you have entered, you have to change all the code from the beginning. It is not easy.
					</p>
					<p>
						The images below are the examples of the work done. You can see the code
						typed into the software to create the website and in the other image you can see the result of the 
						code typed in.
