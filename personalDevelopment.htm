					<h3>Critical Thinking and Problem Solving</h3>
					<p>
						Critical thinking is a skill in which an individual gathers information about a
						topic and then he looks into both the advantages and the disadvantages of that
						situation or the subject. After learning and looking into both cons and pros, the 
						individual then makes an evaluation and ends with making a conclusion. Looking into
						both cons and pros to make a decision is known as the Critical Thinking.
						There have been a few times when i had to think critically, for example, when i had
						decide which university i should go, i went for open days of a few universities. I
						chose to study in Manchester Metropolitan University because it is situated in the
						centre of the city and all the facilities are available. Facilities such as public 
						transport, restaurants, accommodation, Leisure centres and many more. In other
						universities, i learned about the area and compared to MMU, there were less facilities
						available.
					</p>
					<p>
						Problem Solving skill is an essential skill that a graduate must possess. At work you
						can face many problems and issues, some of them are expected while others may be
						unexpected. If a problem arises, you cannot just stop and wait for the problem to be
						resolved by itself, you have to solve the problem and move forward by assessing the
						situation.
						I find myself capable of solving the problems. In computing, we face a number of
						problems and you have to solve them by your own. For example, in programming, you
						may see a problem that needs to be resolved.

					<h3>Professionalism</h3>
					<p>
						It is important to be professional at workplace. To be professional you need to have
						the attributes such as accountability, consideration, communication etc. The employers
						look for individuals with professional behaviours because these individuals are best
						for following the codes of conducts in the workplace.
						This is a skill that i have to work on.
					</p>

					<h3>Communication Skills</h3>
					<p>
						To undertake a task at workplace, you have to communicate with other people, understand
						what they are saying and if you disagree with something then putting your point of 
						view forward. For all this, you have to be good at communication which includes
						speaking, reading, listening and writing.
						I find sometimes difficult to understand people with a different accent. Other than
						that i am able to communicate with people. At my workplace, working as a security
						officer includes a lot of communication with managers, security officers, customers,
						police and many other emmergency services as well.
					</p>

					<h3>Teamwork and Leadership</h3>
					<p>
						Teamwork and Leadership are crucial to be employed. As a security officer, we have to
						work in a team to protect the stock and if someone needs to be stopped. We communicate
						with each other and keep updating about what is our target and what we are looking at.
						Without the teamwork it is hard to undertake the tasks.
						Leading the team is another skill that the employers look for.

					<h3>Learning and Research Skills</h3>
					<p>
						I possess these skills.
